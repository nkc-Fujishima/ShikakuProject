IMPORTANT
**********************
The sound effects have been compressed into ZIP archive(s).

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE?
**********************
It is recommended that you copy and uncompress the ZIP
archives to folders outside of Unity and then import the
appropriate WAV files to the Unity projects you work with.

- 1X_SINGLE_SHOT.zip contains 1600 unique sound effects

- 4X_ROUND_ROBIN.zip* contains 6400 sound effects.
  *) if you purchased the LARGE version of this asset

HOW ?
**********************
Your operating most likely already supports to uncompress ZIP
archives. Try to double click on 1X_SINGLE_SHOT and see if
the archive opens up. If it does, you can usually drag and drop
the content to a folder of your choosing on your computer.

If your operating system does not support opening archived
files - you can download free tools, e.g. 7-Zip for Windows
(http://www.7-zip.org) or iZip for Mac (http://www.izip.com)

WHY ?
**********************
When importing assets packages containing thousands of audio
files into Unity it taks a very long time for Unity to scan
through the files and compress them into an approriate format.
Every time the compile platform is switched, e.g. between PC 
and WebGL, it may take half an hour, or even hours on some
computers, to process thousands audio files.
